Hello, welcome to my dotfiles!

My OS is Arch Linux. I'm currently using i3-gaps + i3blocks-gaps (which I think turned out very pretty),
Neovim and URxvtc [with 24-bit support](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rxvt-unicode-24bit/)!
All powered with Fantasque Sans Mono font, I really like powerline characters.

My Neovim setup uses Deoplete, Vim-Plug and Neomake with some plugins for
autocompleting D, Go and Rust and some Neomake magic for compiling latex.
